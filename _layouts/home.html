    <p>Hey! I'm Dave ðŸ‘‹.</p>

    <p>A few years ago I felt in love with the city of Brighton and Hove. I love putting today guides and exploring this beautiful city through photography.</p>

    <p>I'm always looking for interesting things to do and see and I love getting recommendations from people.</p>

    <p>Please reach out to me Instagram if you have any recommendations.</p>
