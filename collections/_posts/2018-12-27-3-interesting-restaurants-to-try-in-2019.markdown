Every year I try to set myself some New Years intentions (I'm done with resolutions it needs a new name!).

Next year I want to start trying to eat at new places, it's not a new thing I set myself the same goal last year. I decided to write about some of the good places I've eaten at this year for anyone wanting to try new restaurants in 2019. Brighton &amp; Hove certainly has some incredible places.
<h3>Silo Brighton</h3>
This one is very special indeed! It's a zero-waste restaurant located in Upper Gardner Street. Which a very unique interior it's definitely worth a visit if you like wood and steel-furnished aesthetic.

<h3>Bok Shop</h3>
Located in East Street the Bok Shop has amazing burgers and unique side dishes. Great for vegans and vegetarians the inside has a rustic feel to it. I would recommend "The I Believe I Can Thai" burger it's fantastic!

<h3>The Pond</h3>
Super chilled out place not far from the North Laine your find a little pub called the Pond. They have a great selection of Craft Beers but I went after hearing about their Bao menu. If you've not tried a Bao before they are little steamed buns with really yummy fillings!
