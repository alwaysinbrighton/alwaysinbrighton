<p><strong>Pelicano Coffee</strong></p>

<p>Located in Sydney Street Pelicano Coffee has everything people love about a coffee shop. With a great selection of speciality coffees and sweet treats (try the chocolate orange brownie if you can!).</p>

<p><strong>Flower Pot Bakery</strong></p>

<p>Flower Pot was born in Brighton and opened a few locations across Brighton and Hove, when you walk in you'll want to stay there all day! They also have special days were they sell pizza dough and donuts! Not to mention their increible selection of homemade bread.</p>

<p><strong>Bond Street Coffee</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I only discovered Bond Street Coffee late last year, it's the perfect meeting place located just off North Street so very central. The staff are also so helpful and the coffee is super tasty!</p>
